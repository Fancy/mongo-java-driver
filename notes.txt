1) The object to pass to a mongo query should be of the form :

 {
     query : <BSONObject>,
     order : <array>
 }

2) Document all wierd things like count being done via a db eval (see JS code)

3) Need full multi-fetch trip support for Cursor. - done

4) implement fixed size fetches

6) You can create indexes if only the name is different - document that if the keys are the same, it won't be created
   either (https://10gen.fogbugz.com/default.asp?941).  Dwight will fix

7) Document commands ("dropIndexes")

   dropDatabase (done)
   profile
   count     (done)
   create    (done)
   clean     (forgetit)
   drop      (done)
   validate
   deleteIndexes

8) Put in singleton Cursor support so that when a new query is started on a connection, the previous cursor becomes
locked so that it can't do harm

9) ensure that last cursor is killed

10) Collections aren't created w/o an insert - so if you call count, and it doesn't exist...

11) implement DBCursor.count() that's safe

12) Reserved space : connect( "iad-sb-n2/intr" ).cursors.find();

13) note that there are no $ allowed in document fields (or .)

14) ensure support paired mode

15) Capped collections - done

16) profile

17) Index stuff
