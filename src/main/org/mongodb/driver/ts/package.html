<title>Typesafe Mongo DB Driver</title>
<body>

<p><b>Simple Typesafe Java driver for Mongo DB</b></p>
<p>
    This is a basic implementation of the Mongo DB API for Java.  Mongo is a
    fast schema-free document store that stores JSON-like documents in
    groups called collections.  There's a rich query language, and it includes
    features such as indexing, capped tables, replication and more.  The
    Mongo database can be found at <a href="http://www.10gen.com/">http://www.10gen.com</a>.
</p>

<p>
    This is the typesafe driver - there is an object model representing the Mongo
    documents, the query objects, and modifier objects.  If you wish to work w/o the
    rigid object model, please see org.mongo.driver.ts.
</p>

<p>
    This driver models Mongo as a server from which one can create database
    objects for the individual databases, and then from each of those
    collections can be created and used.  In a simple Java example :
</p>
<pre>
<code>
Mongo mongo = new Mongo();  // connect to localhost

DB db = mongo.getDB("myDatabase");

DBCollection coll = db.getCollection("test");
coll.clear();

MongoDoc doc = new MongoDoc();
doc.put("a", 1);
coll.insert(doc);

doc.put("a", 2);
coll.insert(doc);

DBCursor cur = coll.find();

for(MongoDoc d : cur) {
    System.out.println("MongoDoc : " + d);
}
</code>
</pre>
