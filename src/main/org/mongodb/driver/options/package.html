<title>Mongo DB Driver - DB and Collection Options</title>
<body>

<p>
    Database and collection options.
</p>
<p>
    Mongo provides the ability to set two different classes of options :
</p>

<ul>
<li>
    Options on the Database - these are options that affect all operations
    on a given DB object.  Right now, this is limited to setting "strict mode"
    for collection creation and getting.
</li>
<li>
    Options on a collection - these are options that are set at collection
    creation time.  They may not be modified after the collection is created.
    These options are making the collection a "capped collection", or setting
    the initial extent size.
</li>
</ul>

<strong>Database Options</strong>

<p>
    Currently there is only one option you can set on a database - "strict mode" for
    collection creation and getting. By default, Mongo is forgiving when creating a
    collection that already exists, or putting objects into a collection that doesn't -
    it will just do whatever needs to be done to succeed, including creating the
    new colletion for you.
</p>
<p>
    In strict mode, if you try to create a collection that already exists, it will throw
    a MongoDBException.  If you try to get a colletion that doesn't exist, it will throw
    a MongoDBException.
</p>

<p>
    Here's an example of how to set strict mode :
</p>
<pre>
<code>
    Mongo mongo = new Mongo();  // connect to localhost

    DB db = mongo.getDB("myDatabase");
    _db.setDBOptions(new DBOptions().setStrictCollectionMode(true));
</code>
</pre>

<strong>Collection Options</strong>

<p>
    Collection options are set at collection creation time.  Once set, they cannot be changed.  Currently
    there are two options for a collection :
</p>

<ul>
<li>
    Capped Collection:  A capped collection is a byte-size-limited collection that can optionally limit by number of
    documents (up to the byte limit).
</li>
<li>
    Initial Extent : Can be set indepdent of the capped feature.  The initial extent is the first block of storage
    that gets allocated for the collection.  If you know you have a limited collection (say 10 objects), then
    setting the inital extent size allow you to help the system optimize storage as the usual default size for a
    collection can be large.  Note that this isn't harmful - once you fill the initial extent, any further
    object insertions will simply add more storage to the collection as normal.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Here's an example of how to use both
</p>
<pre>
<code>
    Mongo mongo = new Mongo();  // connect to localhost

    DB db = mongo.getDB("myDatabase");
    DBCollection testColl1 = _db.createCollection("test", new DBCollectionOptions().setCapped(2000, 10));
    DBCollection testColl2 = _db.createCollection("test", new DBCollectionOptions().setInitialExtent(2000));
</code>
</pre>
